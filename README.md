Covid-19 and the impact to the financial world

This report is part of the HarvardX course: **PH125.9x Data Science** and contains the results of the final capstone project.  

When searching for a topic for my capstone project, I became interested in a connection between the 
current **Covid-19 pandemic** and the **financial world**. 

When you see the performance of their most important index, the "Dow Jones Industrial Average" (DOW or DJIA) 
one year after the start of the global pandemic in February 2020 this is stronger than ever. 

The financial world seems to be the winner of the crisis.
